    <p>If you re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so Im here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you wont have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and priortize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!.

    <p>Always be true to your own sende of style, if you dont you will e uncomfortable the whole tim and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have choosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you will be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you will be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
